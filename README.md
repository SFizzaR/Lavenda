# Lavenda - Journaling App (Frontend Only)

**Lavenda** is a Flutter-based journaling app that was designed to help users track their moods, maintain a daily journal, and record gratitude logs. Although the app's front-end development is complete, the backend integration (using Firebase) has not been fully implemented due to certain technical challenges.

### Features
- **Mood Tracker**: Track your mood at different times of the day.
- **Journal**: Write and save journal entries.
- **Gratitude Log**: Keep a log of things you're grateful for, promoting a positive mindset.

### Current Status
The app is currently functional on the front-end but lacks a backend to store data. Firebase was intended to be used for the backend to store user data and sync it across devices, but due to issues with setting up the backend, this feature has not been completed. As of now, the app is only functional on the front-end side.

### Technology Stack
- **Flutter**: Front-end development
- **Dart**: Programming language
- **Firebase (Intended)**: Backend (Not implemented due to issues)
- **Android Studio**: Development environment
- **VS Code**: Code editor

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/SFizzaR/Lavenda>
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Android Studio or VS Code).

3. Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can install Flutter by following the instructions on the [Flutter installation page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Known Issues
- **Backend Not Implemented**: Firebase integration for storing data and syncing user data across devices has not been completed.
- **Incomplete Features**: While the front-end features like the mood tracker, journal, and gratitude log are implemented, they currently do not persist data beyond the session.

### Future Plans
- Integrate Firebase for backend functionalities (user authentication, data storage, etc.).
- Improve UI/UX design based on user feedback.
- Add additional features like reminders, mood analytics, and more customization options for journaling.
- Address performance issues and ensure smooth operation on both Android and iOS platforms.
