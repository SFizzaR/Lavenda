# 🪻Lavenda - Journaling App (Frontend Only) 🪻 

**Lavenda** is a Flutter-based journaling app designed to help users track their moods, maintain a daily journal, and record gratitude logs. While the front-end is fully developed, backend integration (intended to use Firebase) has not been implemented due to technical constraints.  

## ✨ Features ✨
- **😊 Mood Tracker** – Log your mood throughout the day.  
- **📖 Journal** – Write and save personal entries.  
- **💖 Gratitude Log** – Keep a record of things you're grateful for.  

## 🚀 Current Status  
- The app's front-end is fully functional.  
- Backend (Firebase) was planned but not implemented.  
- Data does not persist beyond the session.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Flutter** – UI framework  
- **Dart** – Programming language  
- **Android Studio / VS Code** – Development environments  
- **Firebase (Planned)** – For authentication and data storage

2. Open the project in **Android Studio** or **VS Code**.
